Wow, a Scyllascion!
I caught a Scyllascion!
Another Scyllascion?
Hey, it's a Scyllascion!
What luck, a Scyllascion!
By Poseidon's beard, a Scyllascion!
A Scyllascion!
It's a Scyllascion!
Achilles does love his smoked Scyllascion.
The Scyllascion's head is sharper than even Varatha.
Starting with a Scyllascion must mean good fortune.
