I caught a Seamare!
Another Seamare?
A beautiful Seamare!
It's a Seamare!
Ooh a Seamare!
By Poseidon's beard, it's a Seamare!
Nothing matches the beauty of the Seamare.
So many extra frills on this Seamare!
How does the Head Chef cook these Seamares?
Rare catch, a Seamare!
What a lovely bow on this Seamare!
It might not be great eating, but Orpheus loves them.
