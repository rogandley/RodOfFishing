Caught a Chrustacean!
Another Chrustacean.
Just a Chrustacean.
A Chrustacean.
It's a Chrustacean.
Ow! Did this Chrustacean just pinch me?
Baked Chrustacean was always Meg's favorite.
This Chrustacean is still warm to the touch!
From the lava meadows of Asphodel, a Chrustacean.
We can do this, you and I.
A Chrustacean for the Chollection.
